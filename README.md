# NLP_NaiveBayes_ArticleClassification

Here you can find a web scraper to collect a corpus of articles on sports, fashion and science/technology.

You can then use the resulting corpus for exploratory data analysis with numerous visuals and graphs, classification of parts of articles using the Naive Bayes algorithm, and evaluation on the test set.

Note : I used corpus in Croatian language, so it was a bit more challenging.
